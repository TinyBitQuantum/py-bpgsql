Differences from DB-API 2.0
---------------------------

This library tries to follow PEP 249 pretty closely, but currently this
module DOES NOT follow this part of the spec...

    "... Note that if the database supports an auto-commit feature, this
    must be initially off. An interface method may be provided to
    turn it back on."

Nothing is done automagically with transactions, if you want to start
a transaction, you'll have to do it yourself with something like:

    mycursor.execute('BEGIN')

To end a transaction, you may use the connection methods such as:

    myconn.commit()
    myconn.rollback()

or just execute the statements yourself

    mycursor.execute('COMMIT')
    mycursor.execute('ROLLBACK')
