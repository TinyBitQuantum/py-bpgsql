Django 1.0 Backend
------------------

This backend is a work in progress..

Copy or symlink the postgresql_bpgsql directory into your
django/db/backends directory, alongside the existing postgresql_psycopg2
directory

In your Django settings file, use

  DATABASE_ENGINE = 'postgresql_bpgsql'

The rest of the settings should be the same as you'd use with psycopg2
